          Cold email has a frustrating tradeoff: either <span className="text-white">you sacrifice quality for volume ( spray and pray )</span>, or you spend way too much money for people to sit around and write one or two great emails a day. Our Approach is different. Every email we send is timely and relevant, and <span className="text-white">we can do it at infinite scale. We win you millions in pipeline.</span>
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          Scaling personalized cold outbound is also easy to do wrongâ€”which has consequences for both your brand (making you look bad) and your business (losing you money). When you work with us, you're in good hands.

        <p className="text-xl text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          We've sent millions of emails, <span className="text-white">generated nearly $10M in pipeline</span>, and are neurotically obsessed with getting the little details right so everything goes smoothly.
